There are three main types of rocks based on their mineral composition, texture, and
mode of formation:1. <*Igneous Rocks**: These rocks form when molten magma or semi-molten lava cools down and solidifies
over time. The minerals in igneous rocks crystallize from the melt during cooling. Examples include granite, basalt, and
gabbro.2. <*Sedimentary Rocks**: These rocks form when mineral grains, organic matter, or rock fragments accumulate and compact
together due to gravity over long periods of time. The minerals in sedimentary rocks can be derived from the weathering and
erosion of pre-existing rocks, as well as from biological sources such as shells and fossilized remains. Examples include
sandstone, shale, limestone, and coal.3. <*Metamorphic Rocks**: These rocks form when existing igneous, sedimentary, or even
metamorphic rocks undergo a process of transformation due to exposure to high temperatures, pressures, or chemically active fluids
over long periods of time. The minerals in metamorphic rocks rearrange themselves into new mineral structures that are
better suited for the new conditions. Examples include marble (a metamorphosed limestone), schist (a foliated metamorphic rock
composed mainly of mica and quartz), gneiss (a banded metamorphic rock characterized by alternating light and dark bands,
consisting primarily of feldspar and quartz), and slate (a fine-grained, homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original
shale or mudstone).
